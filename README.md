Privacy Policy for [Monksboard]
Last Updated: [01/27/2025]
At Monksboard, we are committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This internal tool is designed to assist our creative teams by generating beautiful and cohesive mood boards based on project descriptions, references, and AI-powered analysis. These mood boards are compiled into a Google Slides presentation, enriched with images sourced from Pinterest.

Key Principles
Empowering Creatives
The purpose of this tool is to streamline the creative process by helping users find and organize visual inspiration for their projects.
All data provided by users (e.g., text inputs, image uploads, or selected references) is processed solely to generate visually cohesive mood boards.
Minimal Data Collection
The tool processes user-provided data temporarily for AI analysis and Google Slides generation.
No personal information is permanently stored unless explicitly required to save or share the resulting presentation.

What Information We Process
The following data is processed temporarily during your session:
Text Inputs: Project descriptions, keywords, and any additional creative guidance.
Uploaded Images: Reference images provided for AI analysis, including visual attributes like mood, colors, shapes, and composition.
Artist References: Choices of artists or styles to guide the AI in curating relevant visuals.
Generated Mood Boards: The final mood board, compiled with AI-analyzed images, is converted into a Google Slides presentation.

How We Use the Information
We use the information provided by users to:
AI-Powered Image Analysis: Analyze uploaded images and reference data to identify visual themes such as mood, color schemes, and shapes.
Image Retrieval: Search and retrieve visually relevant images from Pinterest, guided by the project inputs.
Mood Board Creation: Compile selected images into a visually cohesive Google Slides presentation for creative inspiration and project planning.

Third-Party Services
This tool integrates with external services to deliver its functionality:
Pinterest API: Used to search and retrieve images relevant to the project. Data retrieved through Pinterest is only used to generate the mood board and is not stored or shared further.
Users acknowledge and agree to Pinterest’s Privacy Policy.
Google Slides API: Used to generate a presentation containing the curated mood board. No personal data is stored within the tool itself; the slides are generated and stored within your authorized Google account.

Data Storage and Retention
Temporary Data Use: User-provided data, including text inputs and uploaded images, is processed in real-time and not stored permanently by the tool.
Generated Presentations: Completed Google Slides presentations are saved to the user’s authorized Google account. The tool does not retain copies of these presentations.

User Rights
As an internal tool:
Users retain control over all data they provide, including text inputs and uploaded images.
Users can edit or delete generated Google Slides presentations directly within their Google account.

Security
We prioritize the security of all data processed by the tool:
Uploaded images and text inputs are handled securely during the session and deleted afterward.
Integration with third-party APIs (Pinterest and Google Slides) follows strict security protocols to ensure data privacy and safe communication.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the tool’s functionality or integrations. Any updates will be communicated to users promptly.
